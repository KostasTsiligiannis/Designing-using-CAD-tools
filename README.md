# FPGA-Based Digital Design – E-CAD University Project

> This repository contains a series of exercises and a final project from the “Computer-Aided Design of Systems (E-CAD)” course. We explored circuit design, digital simulation, and FPGA implementation using industry-standard tools.

## Tools & Technologies
-  **OrCAD** – Exercises 1-4: Circuit simulation & schematic design
-  **ModelSim** – Exercise 5: Simulation of digital logic in VHDL
-  **Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA** – Exercises 6-8 and final project: Hardware implementation using Verilog on a development board
-  **Xilinx ISE Design Suite**

## Project Overview

We worked as a team to complete 8 exercises and a final project that gradually introduced us to digital system design, simulation, and hardware implementation.

- **Exercises 1–4:** Schematic entry and simulation with OrCAD
- **Exercise 5:** Writing and simulating VHDL code in ModelSim
- **Exercises 6–8:** Synthesis and implementation on Spartan-3 FPGA using Verilog
- **Final Project:** Full digital system implementation using Verilog and FPGA deployment

The **file `Tasks.pdf`** includes detailed descriptions of the exercises (from page 135 onwards) and the final project topic.

## Team Collaboration
The work was carried out collaboratively as a team, with clear task assignments, documentation, and iterative testing to ensure successful implementation on real hardware.

## Files Included
- `Tasks.pdf`: Description of exercises and final project
- `Modelsim/`: Verilog code and testbenches
- `FPGA/`: Project files for Xilinx ISE
- `Orcad/`: Schematic files for OrCAD simulations
