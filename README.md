# Designing-On-FPGA
We worked as a team in the undergraduate course "ΣΧΕ∆ΙΑΣΗ ΣΥΣΤΗΜΑΤΩΝ ΜΕ ΧΡΗΣΗ ΥΠΟΛΟΓΙΣΤΩΝ (E - CAD)" in the period of an academic semester. We worked on "ORCAD" for the exercises 1-4, on ModelSim for the exercise 5 and on a Xilinx' s fpga (Spartan3 series) for the exercises 6-8 and the project. 
In file "Tasks" you can see the topics of the exercises in pdf (page 135 and below) and of the project
